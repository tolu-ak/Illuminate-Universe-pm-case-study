# Career development & financial workshop pm-case-study 🚀 '

Case study from my Project Management Internship at Illuminate Universe. I led the strategy, roadmap, and delivery of a career and financial literacy workshop in partnership with RBC, focusing on user pain points, feature prioritization, and success metrics.





**Role: Project Management Intern**
Organization: Illuminate Universe
Location: Toronto, ON 
Timeline: May 2023 – July 2023
Partners: The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)
Impact: 30+ students and community members





**📌 Summary**
As a Project Management Intern at Illuminate Universe, I independently led the end-to-end strategy, planning, and delivery of a career development and financial literacy workshop in collaboration with RBC. This experience gave me hands-on exposure to real-world project management workflows, including building roadmaps, prioritizing content based on user needs, stakeholder communication, and defining clear success metrics.





**🎯Objectives** 
Design and deliver a workshop that addresses gaps in career readiness and financial literacy for incoming university students.

Collaborate with external stakeholders (RBC) to align on goals and expectations.

Define a strategy and roadmap for content development, delivery, and feedback loops.

Develop clear metrics for success and measure workshop effectiveness.





**🛠 Tools & PM Techniques Used**
Gantt Chart – Created in Excel to plan tasks, deadlines, and dependencies
Stakeholder Analysis Matrix – To understand influence and expectations
Survey Analysis – Used Google Forms to track engagement and learning outcomes
Slide Deck + Facilitator Notes – Used for internal alignment and workshop delivery and engagement





** 📋 Roadmap & Planning**
I structured the project into three key phases, tracked through a Gantt chart and weekly planning sprints:




**💡Phase	Description**
**Initiation**: Conducted research and informal interviews to identify student pain points around financial literacy and career confidence.

**Planning**: 	Defined scope, and prioritized components of the projects accordingly.

**Delivery & Feedback:** 	Facilitated the workshop, collected feedback through surveys, and conducted post-workshop analysis for improvement.






**🗺️  Prioritization & Strategy**
After identifying multiple student pain points, I used a/b testing alongside the MoSCoW method to prioritize topics that would be the most impactful in my 1-hour timeframe.

Resume Building (Must-Have)
Budgeting & Credit Scores (Must-Have)
Interview Tips (Should-Have)
Personal Branding (Could-Have)
This helped ensure the workshop content remained focused, relevant, and feasible within the time constraints.





**📊 Defining Metrics for Success**
To measure the success of the workshop, I defined the following key metrics:

Engagement Rate – % of participants engaging in live activities and Q&A

Satisfaction Score – Collected post-session via Google Forms (Avg: 4.8/5)

Knowledge Gain – Measured by pre- and post-workshop self-assessments

Retention Indicators – Willingness to recommend or attend future workshops






**💬 Collaboration with RBC**
I facilitated communication between Illuminate and RBC stakeholders to align expectations and deliverables. I ensured the content met RBC’s standards while still being engaging and tailored to a student audience. 

**🧠 Lessons Learned**
Planning is powerful: Having a structured roadmap early on helped me manage scope and avoid burnout.

Prioritization is everything: Saying "no" to low-impact ideas allowed more time for impactful content.

Stakeholder communication: Regular check-ins and expectation alignment avoided miscommunication.

Metrics tell the story: Quantifying impact made it easy to showcase outcomes and improvements.
